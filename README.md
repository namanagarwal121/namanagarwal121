#### Hi, I’m Naman Agarwal.

I’m a Data Engineer with 3+ years of experience designing Azure-integrated data platforms and SQL-driven processing systems. My work involves building ETL/ELT pipelines, implementing transformation logic, and orchestrating cloud-based workflows using Azure services.

I focus on scalable data ingestion architectures, backend data modeling, and production-ready automation within cloud environments.
